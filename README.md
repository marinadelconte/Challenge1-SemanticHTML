# Challenge1-SemanticHTML

## Description

Updated website with HTML Semantics to provide web accessibility to ensure that individuals with disabilities can access the site. Additionally, I adjusted the CSS style sheet to make it more condensed and removed unnecessary commands that were repetitive or could be grouped together. The following changes were made in order to improve accessibility:
    
    -added a header and footer section
    -add alt tags to all images
    -removed the header class and edited the CSS style sheet accordingly
    -removed footer class and edited the CSS style sheet accordingly
    -added a website title on line 7 in html
    -added a nav section for the navigation bar along the top of the page
    -added an aside section for the panel on the right side of the page
    -edited additional div sections to change them to section, main and body where appropriate
    -condensed lines of CSS code to group classes under one command
    -added an id tag to "social-media-marketing" so that the link would have an anchor like the other links at the top of the page


## Usage

The updated website is launched and can be accessed via the following link:
